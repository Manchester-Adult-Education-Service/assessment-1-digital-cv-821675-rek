            I am currently a student at Manchester Adult Education Services (MAES) studying digital skills courses such as Cybersecurity, Networking, Programming. I have also done counselling recently out of interest. I am in the process of applying for jobs in IT as I wish to pursue a career in Software Development or Cybersecurity. I realise that it is very different from healthcare but I do find IT very interesting and fun.

            what you are interested in, and what you hope to do in the future.
